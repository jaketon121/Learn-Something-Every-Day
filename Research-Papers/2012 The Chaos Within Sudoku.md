# [The Chaos Within Sudoku 2012](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00725.pdf)
The mathematical structure of sudoku is like "hard constraint satisfaction problems".
- **constraint satiscaction problems** are defined as sets of objects whose state must satisfy a number of limitations
  - very broad, but the eight queens puzzle is another example, the map 4-colouring problem from Math 239 is another example
- Sudoku is one of **Karp's** 21 NP-complete problems for N x N grids
  - it is called an **exact cover** type problem
  - exact cover in math just means that for a set S of subsets of set X, we want to find a subset of S, S * that contains every element in X exactly once
  - exact cover problem is a decision problem and is NP-complete
- **Boolean Satisfiability Problem** (SAT) tries to find out whether a boolean expression is satisifiable (some possible combination of variables s.t. the expression is TRUE)
  - first proven NP-complete problem
