### Chapter 3: Interest and Equivalence
tl;dr money at different times should be valued at different ratios, based on interest rates that compound
```

              ↑ F=172,220
1965          |
--------------- 2013
|
↓ P=18

F = P(F|P,i,N), F|P mean F given P
F = 18(1+i)^48
solving for i, we get 21% annual ROR over 50 years, or Return on Revenue
```

**Nominal** is the stated interest rate, agnostic of compounding period (sometimes called APR)
- 12% compounded monthly refers to the nominal rate, but is actually **Effectively** 12.68%

Annuity starts not at payment period 0 but at 1.
- P<sub>1</sub> = A(P given A, i, N)
  - multiplying (1+i)<sup>n</sup> is (F/P,i,N)
  - multiply by 1/(1+i)^n is (P/F,i,N)

### Chapter 4: Equivalence of Repeated Cash Flows

For uniform series over time, to calculate future amount:

For uniform series calculating its present value (considering compounding interest):

### Chapter 5: Present Worth Analysis
One way of comparing things is with present worth analysis
- **independent alternatives** are the cash flows of each alternative not relating 
- **mutually exclusive alternatives** choose only one out of many
- **present worth analysis** is evaluating mutually exlcusive alternatives at the present time
  - net present worth = PW(benefit) - PW(cost)

### Chapter 8: Risk
Average, Sqr, Varp, Stdevp, Frequency, Count, Ln

Three risk characteristics of financial assets
- **Horizon**, how long it takes to get money
- **Safety** is there guarantee?
- **Liquidity** how easy it is to sell the asset

**Ex-ante** is the expected return of an investment
- on a bond, we already know what to expect, so you can simply calculate ex-ante

**Ex-post** is a measure of past performance
- actual return realized upon sale of the asset
- will be the same as ex-ante if you sell at bond maturity date


### Chapter 6: Choosing a discount rate
We used net present value and internal rate of return
- for **discounting**,  
- Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the funding cost for many corporate projects

### Chapter 15: Minimum Attractive Rate of Return (MARR)
Assumed interested rate was given so far, but in practice we compute different rates or MARR

- **closed end** mutual funds IPO on stock market and there's a fixed number
- **open end** mutual funds have an unlimited number of units, but must have a reserve for "redemption"
  - redemption has a fee
